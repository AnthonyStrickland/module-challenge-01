# module-challenge-01

## Description

module 1 challenge of a webpage on Horiseon Social Solution Services.  My motivation behind this module was to learn more about html and css files.  this project was 
built in order to help solidify the knowledge I gained in the first module of our bootcamp.  I solved a few problems with this challenge, the first being the ability to
clean up code and have one block of code in css used for multiple sections in my html file.  Another is ensuring the website functions as advertised and all links navigate
to their proper section
